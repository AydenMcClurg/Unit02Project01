        <p>I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard.<br> 
        They did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up<br> 
        that same day. Great service.<br>

        <p>Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide <br>
        an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid.<br>
        I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.<br>

        <p>Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up.<br>
        They took extra care not to disturb my lawn and garden. I highly recommend<br>
        their service.<br>
